You can get your Shopify store up and running with pre-built themes and minimal technical knowledge. Shopify stores offer easy scalability to accommodate your growing business and changing consumer behavior, secure payment gateways to handle sensitive data, precise tax calculations for straightforward financial overviews and regular updates for optimal functionality. One potential challenge with this eCommerce platform is its three-option limit — you can add three variant options and each product can have up to 100 variants. Options refer to signature product features or attributes — like color, size or material — while variants are specific option combinations, such as a blue, medium-sized, cotton shirt. The Shopify platform also lacks its own customizable backend, making it challenging to add third-party integrations without costly apps.Partnering with an end-to-end Shopify web design company means you can successfully mitigate these challenges and create a unique, fully functional eCommerce store.",
